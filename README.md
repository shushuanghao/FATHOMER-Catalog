This catalog presents the parameters of H I candidates extracted from ∼60 deg² of sky observed by FATHOMER. 
The survey area is continuous and complete, covering the coordinate range 135 < R.A. < 195 and 25.7 < Decl. < 26.7.
Code 1 refers to sources that have been observed by both ALFALFA and FATHOMER.
Code 2 refers to some new sources found by FATHOMER, which have been matched with OCs with known optical redshifts obtained from the spectrum of the galaxies. 
Code 3 refers to some FAST newly found sources, which have been matched with OCs with uncertain optical redshifts.
Code 4 refers to some FAST newly found sources, which have no OCs by cross-matched with the SDSS photometric catalogue.
Code 5 refers to soources that have been  observed by ALFALFA and been contaminated by the strong RFIs in FATHOMER.
